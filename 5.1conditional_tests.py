# Chapter 5-1 Exercise: Conditional Tests
# Write a series of conditional tests. Print out a statement describing each test and your prediction for
# the results of each test. 

# 1st & 2nd conditional test
car = 'camaro'
print("Is car == 'camaro'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'camaro')

print("\nIs car == 'mazda'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'mazada')

# 3rd & 4th Conditional test
name = 'mohamad'
print("\nIs name == 'mohamad'? I predict True.")
print(name == 'mohamad')

print("\nIs name == 'lauren'? I predict False.")
print(name == 'lauren')

# 5th and 6th conditional test
food = 'burger'
print("\nIs food == 'burger'? I predict True.")
print(food == 'burger')

print("\nIs food == 'pizza'? I predict False.")
print(food == 'pizza')

# 7th and 8th conditional test
restaurant = 'potbelly'
print("\nIs restaurant == 'potbelly'? I predict True.")
print(restaurant == 'potbelly')

print("\nIs restaurant == 'firehouse subs'? I predict False.")
print(restaurant == 'firehouse subs')

# 9th and 10th conditional
best_english_player = 'saka'
print("\nDoes best_english_player == 'saka'? I predict True.")
print(best_english_player == 'saka')

print("\nDoes best_english_player == 'cole palmer'? I predict False.")
print(best_english_player == 'cole palmer')
